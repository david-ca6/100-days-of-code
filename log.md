# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 07 2022
**Today's Progress**   
I'm starting to learn to program in go.
I've set up my go development environment in toolbx container on RHEL 9 with vscode as IDE. 
I've gone through tutorials 1-2 of the go.dev documentation.

### Day 2: June 08 2022
**Today's Progress**  
I'm learning to program in go.  
I've gone through tutorials 3-4 of the go.dev documentation.  
Learning to use go workspace and how to use go with the Gin Web Framework.

### Day 3: June 09 2022
**Today's Progress**  
I'm learning Go Programming.  
I've been playing with the Gin Web Framework to make an API similar to what I made in the past using C for work.  
GO and Gin makes the process way faster and easier.  
**Thoughts**   
By comparing the executable compiled from C with the one compiled from GO.  
(boot executable accepts the same GET/POST, uses the same data and writes the same log)   
The go executable is 5 times bigger than the C executable, but t is negligible. (2MB vs 10MB)  
There is no significant difference in speed between the 2 executables, both are mostly IO limited
